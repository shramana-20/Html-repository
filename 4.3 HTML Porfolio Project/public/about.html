<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Shramana Ghosh, a final-year Computer Science student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. My journey in tech has been deeply enriched by a recent summer internship with Qualcomm, where I earned a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO). I’m particularly passionate about machine learning and web development, fields where I aim to create impactful solutions.

<p>Beyond academics, dance has always been close to my heart. I hold a diploma in dance and have served as the Secretary of Cypher, BITS Hyderabad’s dance club, where I had the pleasure of organizing flash mobs, competitions, and unique events. Dance has been a transformative experience, balancing my rigorous tech pursuits with creativity and rhythm.
